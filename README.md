# Machine & Deep Learning in the Financial Markets
### Udacity Machine Learning Engineer: Capstone Project

The search for algorithms that can predict future price movements is the holy grail of finance, and has been coined 'the truth' by quants. While algorithmic trading is nothing new and the computerization of order flow began in the 1970's, the last decade has seen a radical shift in three areas causing what has been termed the fourth industrial revolution. As this [Machine Learning & Big Data paper by J.P. Morgan](http://valuesimplex.com/articles/JPM.pdf) puts it:

"In fact, over the past year, the exponential increase of the amount and types of data available to investors prompted some to completely change their business strategy and adopt a ‘Big Data’ investment framework. Other investors may be unsure on how to assess the relevance of Big Data and Machine Learning, how much to invest in it, and many are still paralyzed in the face of what is also called the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution."

Massive increases in data, access to low cost computing power, and advances in machine learning have significantly changed the financial industry. This paper will explore how several machine and deep learning algorithms can be applied in the cryptocurrency market. In particular, we will apply regression-based machine and deep learning algorithms on the BTC-USD dataset.

Libraries used include:
- Ta-Lib
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Tensorflow
